# On viewing the Event Propagation/Nested Button Clicks assignment
Within your IDE, if starting from absolute scratch, navigate to where you want to install the Event Propagation assignment project and you must run "npx create-react-app event-propagation-assignment" to initialize a React application project. Then, you must enter "cd event-propagation" to change directories into the project file. 
Once there, run "npm start" to begin the application server.

Adding the NestedButtons.js, App.css, and the App.js from the repo to the "src" branch of the project should allow this project to run locally.
